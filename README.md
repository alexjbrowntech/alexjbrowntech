## About me
<details open>
<summary>Biography</summary>
    
 I'm Alexander and after working in theatre (Director/Producer) and education (Learning Support Worker), I am now a Full-Stack Software Developer. 
   
 After studying with School of Code in 2023 and moving on to my own projects in software and web development, I found my past experiences have made me an excellent problem solver who can manage complex workloads. After performing a panto simultaneously in spoken English and British Sign Language and having to improvise in both in front of an audience, I can confidently say I tackle unexpected challenges head on.
